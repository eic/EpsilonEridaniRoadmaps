# Roadmap: contour integration and the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem

**Status: declared complete by the maintainers (2026-08-29).** The library this roadmap asked for
has been built, sorry-free, in [EpsilonEridani](https://github.com/EpsilonEridaniProject/EpsilonEridani) under
`EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/`. All four layers are there: the generalized winding number and its
model-sector geometry (L0–L1), residues with the argument principle and the classical residue
theorem (L2), the homology Cauchy theorem by Dixon's argument (L3), and the summit — the
Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem for singularities lying *on* the cycle, with
non-integer winding-number weights (L4).

Every target of the sibling `Suggested.lean` is discharged in place: each is stated exactly as this
roadmap asked for it, then closed by the declaration that realizes it, so the correspondence is
checked by the Lean kernel rather than asserted here. Every signature matched
hypothesis-for-hypothesis, so no target needed restating or bridging. The five acceptance criteria
in *Worked examples* below are met too, including the Dirichlet integral
(`∫₀^R sin x / x → π/2`), the improper-integral application that motivates HW Thm 3.3.

Declaring this complete remains a human judgment against this README, which is the definitive
document. What the discharged file removes is the bookkeeping half of that judgment, not the
mathematical half.

This roadmap is archived and no longer offered to contributors.
Mathlib has the Cauchy integral formula and the Cauchy–Goursat theory
(`Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/CauchyIntegral.lean`), circle integrals
(`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/CircleIntegral.lean`), and the local theory of
meromorphic functions (`Mathlib/Analysis/Meromorphic/*`, including `meromorphicOrderAt`
and the principal-part machinery). But the residue calculus it can reach is the **classical**
one, where the singularities lie strictly *off* the contour and the winding number is an
integer.

The ultimate target of this roadmap is the **Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue
theorem** (N. Hungerbühler, M. Wasem, *Non-integer valued winding numbers and a generalized
Residue Theorem*, arXiv:1808.00997, 2018): a residue theorem that remains valid when the
singularities lie **on** the contour, with the residues weighted by a **non-integer-valued
winding number** `n_{z₀}(C) = PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_C dz/(z − z₀)` that has a genuine geometric
meaning (an angle, divided by `2π`) for points on the curve. Along the way we build its
prerequisites — the generalized winding number and its geometry, the classical residue
theorem, and the global (homological) Cauchy theorem — none of which Mathlib has.

This is ordinary complex analysis, and Mathlib does not have it. We build it in Tau Ceti; if Mathlib later develops the same material, Tau Ceti refactors onto its version, as usual. The first client is
arithmetic: the **valence formula** (in the separate
[Modular Forms roadmap](../ModularForms/README.md)) integrates `f'/f` around the boundary of
the standard fundamental domain — a contour that *passes through* the elliptic points `i` and
`ρ`. Their fractional contributions to the valence formula (`½` at `i`, `⅓` at `ρ`) are
exactly Hungerbühler–Wasem winding numbers of points on the contour. So the non-integer
theory is not decoration; it is the engine the modular application runs on.

Suggested home: `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/`.

## Standing conventions

- **Curves, immersions, cycles.** A piecewise-`C¹` curve is a continuous `γ : [a,b] → ℂ`,
  `C¹` on each piece of a finite partition. A **closed piecewise-`C¹` immersion** additionally
  has `γ' ≠ 0` on each piece and `γ a = γ b` (HW's standing object); a **cycle** is a finite
  formal `ℤ`-combination of closed curves. Reuse Mathlib's `intervalIntegral` and
  `HasDerivAt`; do not introduce a bespoke path type where a function on `[a,b]` suffices.
- **The contour integral is `∫ t in a..b, γ' t • f (γ t)`** (`intervalIntegral`), agreeing
  with `circleIntegral` on a circle. State results about this integral; do not wrap it.
- **The generalized winding number** of a cycle `C` about any `z₀ ∈ ℂ` — including `z₀ ∈ C` —
  is `n_{z₀}(C) := PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_C dz/(z − z₀)` (HW Def 2.1), normalized so a single
  counterclockwise circle about an interior point has winding `1`. For `z₀ ∉ C` this is the
  classical integer index; for `z₀ ∈ C` it is in general **non-integer**.
- ⚠ **A principal value is not an ordinary integral.** When `z₀ ∈ C`, both the winding
  integral and `∮_C f` diverge; the Cauchy principal value is the symmetric-excision limit.
  Keep the PV predicate (`HasCauchyPV …`, an existence-and-value statement) separate from
  genuine integrability, and never silently identify them.
- **Residues via the order/`Laurent` API.** The residue at an isolated singularity is the
  order-`(−1)` Laurent coefficient; reuse `meromorphicOrderAt` and the principal-part
  machinery. For a simple pole it is `lim_{z→z₀}(z − z₀) f(z)`. Do not define a parallel
  "order of vanishing".

## What Mathlib already has (consume)

- **Cauchy's theorem and the integral formula:** `Mathlib/Analysis/Complex/CauchyIntegral.lean`
  (`circleIntegral.integral_sub_center_inv`, the Cauchy integral formula, the disc/annulus
  theory).
- **Circle integrals:** `circleIntegral`, `∮ z in C(c, R), f z`
  (`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/CircleIntegral.lean`); `circleMap` is now in
  `Mathlib/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Complex/CircleMap.lean`.
- **Meromorphic functions:** `MeromorphicAt` and `MeromorphicOn`
  (`Mathlib/Analysis/Meromorphic/Basic.lean`), `meromorphicOrderAt`
  (`Mathlib/Analysis/Meromorphic/Order.lean`), and the principal-part machinery — the residue is
  the order-`(−1)` Laurent coefficient against this API.
- **Interval integrals and the FTC:** `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Integral/IntervalIntegral.lean`,
  `…/FundThmCalculus.lean` — the substrate for the arc FTC and the real winding integral.
- **Homotopy of paths:** `Mathlib/Topology/Homotopy/Path.lean` — the input to homotopy invariance
  of the winding number off the curve.
  ⚠ Mathlib has **no packaged signed-curvature notion for plane curves** (a grep of the pinned
  toolchain finds nothing usable), so signed curvature is **not** in this consume list. HW Prop 2.3's
  crossing value is the standard `½·k_Λ·|Λ̇|`, which for a plane curve `Λ = x + iy` is the elementary
  rational expression `(ẋÿ − ẏẍ)/(2(ẋ² + ẏ²))`. The roadmap states the value in this explicit form —
  exactly as HW do and as the `sorry`-free AINTLIB proof formalizes it — rather than routing it
  through a general signed-curvature theory; `k_Λ` is the textbook signed curvature, not a Tau-Ceti
  coinage. A module-docstring note should simply record that the value is given by the explicit
  formula because Mathlib has no signed-curvature API to cite.

## What is missing (build here)

The generalized winding number for points on a cycle (HW Def 2.1) and its geometry (the model
sector value `α/2π`, the finite-crossing decomposition HW Prop 2.2, the real bounded-integrand
formula and the `½·curvature` value HW Prop 2.3); the residue against `meromorphicOrderAt`
and the **classical residue theorem** `∮_C f = 2πi · Σ_s n_s(C)·Res_s f` for a cycle avoiding
its poles; the **global (homological) Cauchy theorem** (proved by Dixon's argument); and the
headline **Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem** (HW Thm 3.3), valid with
singularities *on* the cycle. None of this is upstream.

`Suggested.lean` pins the load-bearing **definitions** — the generalized `windingNumber`, the
`residue`, the Cauchy principal value `HasCauchyPV`, and the HW conditions `ConditionAprime` /
`ConditionB` (with `IsNullHomologous`) — together with the **named milestones** below as
`sorry`-targets, so each is claimable and the summit statement is machine-checked to be expressible
(Mathlib has none of these objects).

## The build, in layers

The ordering is the dependency order. As each layer makes the next layer's *types*
expressible in `EpsilonEridani/`, its milestones go into `Suggested.lean` (with `sorry`).

### Layer 0: curves, cycles, and the generalized winding number
- **Piecewise-`C¹` curves, closed immersions, and cycles** on `[a,b]`: continuity, piecewise
  derivative, the non-vanishing-derivative condition, closedness; interval-integrability of
  `γ'·(f ∘ γ)` for `f` continuous on the image.
- **The generalized winding number** `n_{z₀}(C) = PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_C dz/(z − z₀)` (HW Def 2.1),
  *defined for every* `z₀ ∈ ℂ`, including `z₀ ∈ C`.
- **The classical case** `z₀ ∉ C`: the PV is an ordinary integral, `n_{z₀}(C) ∈ ℤ`
  (integrality via the primitive-of-`exp` argument), homotopy-invariant in `ℂ ∖ C`, and `0`
  on the unbounded component.
  ⚠ Integrality holds **only** off the curve; the whole point of Layer 1 is that on the curve
  the winding number is geometric and non-integer.

### Layer 1: the geometry of the generalized winding number (HW §2)
- **The model sector** (HW (2.4)): for the corner curve made of a segment, an arc of opening
  angle `α`, and a return segment, `n₀(γ) = α/2π`. So a point at a corner of interior angle
  `α` has winding `α/2π`. The **valence formula uses exactly these values**: at the *smooth*
  boundary point `i` the contour indents by a semicircle (`α = π`), winding **`½`** (the
  coefficient of `ord_i f`); at the `π/3` corner `ρ` it indents by a `π/3` arc, winding
  **`1/6`** — and the two `ρ`-corners `ρ`, `ρ+1` sum to the `⅓` coefficient of `ord_ρ f`.
  Both `½` and `1/6` are seeded in `Suggested.lean`.
- **HW Proposition 2.2 (finite crossings and the winding decomposition).** A closed
  piecewise-`C¹` immersion `Λ` meets any `z₀` at most finitely often; writing
  `Λ = Λ̃ + Γ₁ + … + Γₙ` where `Λ̃` avoids `z₀` and each `Γ_ℓ` is a model sector of angle
  `α_ℓ`, `n_{z₀}(Λ) = n_{z₀}(Λ̃) + Σ_ℓ α_ℓ/2π`. (The finiteness is a Rolle's-theorem argument
  on the immersion.)
- **HW Proposition 2.3 (the real, bounded-integrand formula).** For a closed piecewise-`C^{1,1}`
  immersion `Λ = x + iy`, `n₀(Λ) = (1/2π) ∫_a^b (x ẏ − y ẋ)/(x² + y²) dt` with **bounded
  integrand** (no principal value needed in the real form), and at a crossing `t̃` (where
  `Λ(t̃) = 0`) the integrand tends to `½·k_Λ(t̃)·|Λ̇(t̃)| = (ẋÿ − ẏẍ)/(2(ẋ² + ẏ²))` at `t̃`, half
  the signed curvature times speed. This is the computational workhorse — a genuine integral, not a
  PV.
  ⚠ Pin the regularity per part: the **bounded integrand** — all the residue theorem actually needs —
  holds for `C^{1,1}`, while the **crossing value** `½·k·|Λ̇|` needs `C²` near `t̃` for `k` to be
  pointwise defined. Here `k_Λ` is the standard signed curvature, given by the explicit formula above;
  Mathlib has no signed-curvature API to consume (see the consume list), so state it explicitly, as HW
  and the AINTLIB proof do.
  ⚠ The complex form needs the PV; the real form does not. Keep both and relate them.

### Layer 2: residues, the Cauchy primitive, and the classical residue theorem
- **FTC along an arc:** if `F' = f` on a neighbourhood of `image γ`, then
  `∮_γ f = F(γ b) − F(γ a)`, hence `0` for a closed curve; Cauchy's theorem for a contractible
  contour as a corollary (reconciled with Mathlib's disc statements).
- **Residue at an isolated singularity** `Res_{z₀} f` (the order-`(−1)` Laurent coefficient;
  for a simple pole the limit `lim_{z→z₀}(z − z₀)f(z)`); `ℂ`-linearity; the **simple-pole
  decomposition** `f = (holomorphic) + Σ_s (Res_s f)/(z − s)`.
- **The classical residue theorem** — two scopes, deliberately kept apart:
  - *Layer 2 (here): the disc/circle case* `∮_{C(c,R)} f = 2πi · Σ_s Res_s f` for a circle bounding
    a disc with the finite pole set `S` strictly **inside** (each interior pole has integer winding
    `1`), provable from Mathlib's disc Cauchy theory — seeded as `classicalResidueTheorem_circle` in
    `Suggested.lean`, and recovering the Cauchy integral formula.
  - *The general arbitrary-cycle case* `∮_C f = 2πi · Σ_s n_s(C)·Res_s f` for a closed
    piecewise-`C¹` cycle `C` avoiding `S`. ⚠ Avoiding `S` is **not** sufficient on an arbitrary
    holomorphy domain `Ω`: `C` must be **null-homologous in `Ω`** (`n_w(C) = 0` for every `w ∉ Ω`).
    This version is **at least as strong as the homology Cauchy theorem** — its `S = ∅` case is
    exactly `∮_C f = 0` for null-homologous `C` (Layer 3) — so it is **deferred to Layer 3+**, not
    proved here. The bare circle case with poles *off* the circle is already a short corollary of
    Mathlib's Cauchy integral formula, so it is *not* what the engine adds.
- **The argument principle** (the valence formula's contour identity) — what the engine *does*
  add. Applying the residue theorem to `f'/f = logDeriv f`, `(2πi)⁻¹ ∮_C f'/f = Σ_z ord_z(f)`
  counts zeros minus poles with multiplicity (`Res_z (f'/f) = ord_z f`). Mathlib has `logDeriv`
  and `meromorphicOrderAt` but **not** this identity; it is the explicit result the valence
  formula consumes, and the milestone seeded in `Suggested.lean`. The interior orders give the
  non-elliptic-orbit sum; the on-contour points `i`, `ρ` are handled by HW Thm 3.3 (Layer 4).

### Layer 3: the global (homological) Cauchy theorem
- **The homology form of Cauchy's theorem**: for `f` holomorphic on open `Ω` and a cycle `C`
  in `Ω` that is **null-homologous** (`n_w(C) = 0` for every `w ∉ Ω`), `∮_C f = 0` and
  `f(z)·n_z(C) = (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_C f(w)/(w − z) dw`. Subsumes the null-homotopic case (null-homotopic
  ⟹ null-homologous, not conversely) and is the hypothesis under which HW Thm 3.3 is stated.
  ⚠ This is **not** called "Dixon's theorem" — it is the homology Cauchy theorem; *Dixon's
  argument* [Dixon 1971] is the slick proof (the auxiliary `g(w,z) = (f(w)−f(z))/(w−z)`
  extends holomorphically across the diagonal, so `z ↦ ∮_C g(w,z)dw` extends to a bounded
  entire function, hence `0`). Name the theorem, attribute the proof.

### Layer 4: the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem (HW Theorem 3.3)
- **The headline.** Let `U ⊆ ℂ` be open, `S ⊆ U` finite, `f` holomorphic on `U ∖ S` and
  meromorphic at each point of `S`, and `C` a **null-homologous** closed piecewise-`C¹` immersion
  in `U` whose singularities may lie **on** `C`. Then
  `PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_C f dz = Σ_{s ∈ S} n_s(C)·Res_s f`,
  with the **generalized (non-integer) winding numbers** of Layer 1 as the weights. Subsumes
  the classical residue theorem (Layer 2, poles off `C`, integer weights) and the half-residue
  case (`S = {s}` with winding `½`: an on-cycle simple pole contributes `πi·Res_s f`).
  The pinned form (`Suggested.lean`) takes a single closed curve, a finite `S`, and
  `MeromorphicAt` at each singularity, with the basepoint off the poles — deliberately narrower
  than the paper's cycle, accumulation-free `S`, and locally-straight essential singularities;
  the docstring records each narrowing.
- **The two regularity conditions** under which the paper-faithful form holds: condition (A′)
  (the cycle approaches each on-cycle singularity transversally / as a finite union of sectors,
  with a prescribed pole order) and condition (B) (the higher-order Laurent parts cancel by the
  sector-cancellation identity). State both explicitly; they are what make the PV exist.
- **Higher-order poles.** The simple-pole case first, then the general meromorphic case via the
  Laurent principal part — HW handle order `> 1` through the sector cancellation under (B).
- **Applications.** The improper integrals (singular integrals, Cauchy principal values along
  the real axis) that the classical residue theorem cannot reach — HW's motivating use — and
  the valence formula's treatment of `i` and `ρ`.

---

## Worked examples (acceptance criteria, keeping the theory honest)

- **Model sector:** a point at a corner of interior angle `α` has winding `α/2π`; a smooth
  crossing (`α = π`) has winding `½` (HW (2.4)).
- `n_c(circle) = 1` for a counterclockwise circle about an interior `c` (`windingNumber_circle`,
  reconciling with `circleIntegral.integral_sub_center_inv`); `n` is `0` outside.
- **Classical residue theorem** with two simple poles inside a circle returns
  `2πi·(Res₁ + Res₂)`; the one-pole case is the Cauchy integral formula.
- **A simple pole on the contour** contributes the **half-residue** `πi·Res_s f` (winding `½`)
  — the on-cycle acceptance test (`hasCauchyPV_half_residue`), and the bridge to the valence
  formula's `i` and `ρ`.
- **An improper integral** (e.g. a Cauchy principal value along the real axis with a simple
  pole at `0`) evaluated by HW Thm 3.3 where the classical theorem does not apply — HW's
  motivating example.

## Ordering

Layer 0 (the generalized winding number) and Layer 1 (its geometry, HW §2) are the foundation
and come first. Layer 2 (residues + the classical residue theorem) and Layer 3 (the homology
Cauchy theorem, via Dixon's argument) are the classical backbone. Layer 4 (HW Thm 3.3) is the
summit that unifies them and is the layer the valence formula imports; it is also the most
technical, since the principal-value excision estimates and conditions (A′)/(B) live there.

The whole development is **migrated and cleaned** from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB)), where the
Hungerbühler–Wasem theorem is formalized `sorry`-free as
`HungerbuhlerWasem.residueTheorem_crossing_paper_faithful_clean` (HW Thm 3.3) on top of the
`GeneralizedResidueTheory` tree (`generalizedResidueTheorem'`, `generalizedResidueTheorem`,
`generalizedResidueTheorem_higher_order`, `HasCauchyPVOn'`, `residueAt`), the winding-number
files, and `HW33`/`HW33Clean`/`HungerbuhlerWasem/{Crossing,MultiCrossingCPV}`. The migration
is the opportunity to state these in Mathlib's vocabulary, drop the fundamental-domain-specific
scaffolding (which stays with the valence formula in the Modular Forms roadmap), and give them
the general statements the layers above consume. The per-file map is in `Suggested.lean`.
