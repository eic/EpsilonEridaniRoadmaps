# Contour integration and the HW generalized residue theorem: target signatures

**This file is not the roadmap and is not exhaustive.** The definitive document is
`README.md`. The statements here suggest Lean forms for particular milestones, so that
contributors and reviewers converge on names and signatures; discharging all of them
finishes neither a layer nor the roadmap.

The narrative roadmap (the conventions, the layer-by-layer build plan Layers 0–4, the worked
examples, and the references) is in `README.md`. Mathlib has the Cauchy integral formula, circle
integrals, and the local meromorphic-function API (`MeromorphicOn` in
`Analysis/Meromorphic/Basic.lean`, `meromorphicOrderAt` in `Analysis/Meromorphic/Order.lean`,
`circleMap`/`circleIntegral` in `MeasureTheory/Integral/CircleIntegral.lean` and
`Analysis/SpecialFunctions/Complex/CircleMap.lean`, the Cauchy kernel
`circleIntegral.integral_sub_center_inv`). It has **no** winding number for a general
piecewise-`C¹` cycle, **no** residue, **no** Cauchy principal-value contour integral, **no**
argument principle, **no** global (homological) Cauchy theorem, and — the ultimate target — **no**
Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem (arXiv:1808.00997, Thm 3.3) for singularities lying
*on* the cycle, with non-integer winding-number weights. We build that in `EpsilonEridani/Analysis/Contour/`.

This file pins the roadmap's load-bearing **definitions** (`windingNumber`, `residue`,
`HasCauchyPV`, `IsPiecewiseC1On`, `IsPwC1ImmersionOn`, the HW conditions, `IsNullHomologous`) and its
**named milestones**. Each is now **discharged**: stated exactly as the roadmap asked for it, then
closed by the Tau Ceti declaration that realizes it, so the correspondence is checked by the Lean
kernel rather than asserted in prose. Nothing here records a status by hand — the remaining
`sorry` count is the remaining work, and it is zero. Every signature matched Tau Ceti
hypothesis-for-hypothesis, including both summits, so no target needed restating or bridging.

Verified against Tau Ceti `6a13d4d1` with Mathlib `e310d5e0` and toolchain `v4.34.0-rc1`, and
also against the revision this repository currently pins. The
`def`s fix the objects the roadmap is *about* so the statements below are expressible at all; the
generalized winding number, the classical residue theorem, the homology Cauchy theorem and HW
Thm 3.3 are then stated against them.

The argument-principle milestones are statable today with Mathlib's `logDeriv` (`= f'/f`),
`meromorphicOrderAt` (`= ord_c f`), and `circleIntegral`, yet are genuinely absent from Mathlib
(which has `logDeriv`, `Meromorphic/Divisor`, Jensen's formula, and Nevanlinna theory, but no
residue, argument principle, or winding number). The bare residue theorem for poles *off* a circle
is a short corollary of the Cauchy integral formula and so is folded into the Layer-2
`classicalResidueTheorem_circle` only; the general arbitrary-cycle / null-homologous residue theorem
is Layer 3+ (it is at least as strong as the homology Cauchy theorem). Everything here elaborates
against the pinned Mathlib.

## Provenance (migrate and clean from AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`)

The proofs exist, `sorry`-free, in the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB)); migrating them is the
cleanup opportunity. File map (relative to that project's `LeanModularForms/`):

* Generalized winding number (Layers 0–1, HW §2): `ForMathlib/GeneralizedWindingNumber.lean`,
  `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/Homotopy/{Invariance,Integrality}.lean`,
  `ForMathlib/HungerbuhlerWasem/Crossing.lean` (Prop 2.2 / sector geometry).
* Arc FTC / Cauchy primitive (Layer 2): `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/CauchyPrimitive.lean`,
  `…/ArcCalculus.lean`, `ForMathlib/ArcFTC*.lean`.
* Residues, the argument principle, and the classical residue theorem (Layer 2):
  `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/Residue.lean`, `…/Residue/GeneralizedTheoremBase.lean`
  (`generalizedResidueTheorem'`, `residueSimplePole`, `residueAt`, `simple_poles_decomposition`).
* Global (homological) Cauchy theorem, via Dixon's argument (Layer 3):
  `ForMathlib/DixonDef.lean`, `…/DixonDiff.lean`, `…/DixonTheorem.lean`.
* HW generalized residue theorem (Layer 4, Thm 3.3, conditions (A′)/(B)):
  `ForMathlib/HW33Clean.lean` (`hw_3_3_clean_full_mero`),
  `ForMathlib/HungerbuhlerWasem/MultiCrossingCPV.lean` (the paper-faithful
  `HungerbuhlerWasem.residueTheorem_crossing_paper_faithful_clean` and the multi-crossing PV
  engine), `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/{Residue/MultipointPV*,OnCurvePV/*,PVInfrastructure/*}`,
  `ForMathlib/GeneralizedResidueTheory/Residue.lean` (`HasCauchyPVOn'`,
  `pv_integral_simple_pole`).

The fundamental-domain-specific winding machinery (`ForMathlib/*FDBoundary*`, `*CornerFTC*`,
`*CrossingAt{Rho,I}*`, `*ExitTime*`) is **not** migrated here; it is the bridge from this engine to
the valence formula and stays in the Modular Forms roadmap.

/-! ## The objects (Layers 0, 2, 4): the definitions the roadmap is about

Mathlib has none of these. The contour integral itself is `∫ t in a..b, deriv γ t • f (γ t)`
(`intervalIntegral`, agreeing with `circleIntegral` on a circle); these `def`s name the winding
number, residue, principal value, and the HW hypotheses built on it. -/

/-- **Generalized winding number** (HW Def 2.1): `n_{z₀}(γ) = PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_γ dz/(z − z₀)`, the
value of the contour integral for *any* piecewise-`C¹` curve `γ : ℝ → ℂ` on `[a, b]` and *any*
`z₀ ∈ ℂ`. Closedness (`γ a = γ b`) is **not** part of the definition; it is the hypothesis (carried
on the theorems below) under which this value is a genuine winding number — the classical integer
index for `z₀ ∉ image γ`, and in general **non-integer** for `z₀` on the curve (the geometric angle
`α/2π`). -/
noncomputable def windingNumber (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (z₀ : ℂ) : ℂ :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber γ a b z₀

/-- **Residue** at an isolated singularity: the order-`(−1)` Laurent coefficient of `f` at `z₀`
(for a simple pole, `lim_{z→z₀}(z − z₀)·f z`), against the `meromorphicOrderAt` / principal-part
API rather than a parallel order-of-vanishing notion. -/
noncomputable def residue (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z₀ : ℂ) : ℂ := EpsilonEridani.Contour.residue f z₀

/-- **Cauchy principal value** of a contour integral, existence-and-value form (HW): `HasCauchyPV γ
a b f v` says the symmetric-excision limit of `∮_γ f` exists and equals `v`. This is needed exactly
when a singularity of `f` lies *on* `γ`, where the ordinary integral diverges; it is kept **separate
from genuine integrability** and never silently identified with it. Layer 4 cannot be stated without
it. -/
def HasCauchyPV (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (v : ℂ) : Prop :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.HasCauchyPV γ a b f v

/-- **Piecewise `C¹` on the interval between `a` and `b`.** The raw-function curve-regularity
hypothesis: `γ` is continuous on `[[a, b]]` (Mathlib's `Set.uIcc a b`, the interval robust to `a > b`) and, off
a finite breakpoint set, is `C¹` on each closed
piece. This is the regularity that AINTLIB's bundled `PiecewiseC1Path` carries *inside its type*;
stated on a raw `γ : ℝ → ℂ` it must be an **explicit hypothesis**, because the winding number, the
contour integral `∫ deriv γ • f (γ ·)`, and Dixon's argument are all ill-posed for an arbitrary
continuous `γ`: a space-filling continuous `γ` has no honest derivative, so `∫ deriv γ • …` is not
the contour integral at all, and Dixon's argument needs differentiability off a countable set to
make the winding number integer-valued. (The off-curve base point Dixon picks, by contrast, exists
already from continuity and compactness — the image of `[[a, b]]` is compact, so it cannot fill a
nonempty open `Ω` — and is not what this regularity is for.) This mirrors
`EpsilonEridani.Contour.IsPiecewiseC1On`; it is the base regularity the homology Cauchy theorem (Layer 3)
carries. The **on-cycle** residue theorems (Layer 4) need the stronger `IsPwC1ImmersionOn` below. -/
def IsPiecewiseC1On (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ContinuousOn γ (Set.uIcc a b) ∧
    ∃ p : Finset ℝ, ↑p ⊆ Set.Ioo (min a b) (max a b) ∧
      ∀ c d : ℝ, Set.Icc c d ⊆ Set.uIcc a b → Disjoint (↑p : Set ℝ) (Set.Ioo c d) →
        ContDiffOn ℝ 1 γ (Set.Icc c d)

/-- **Piecewise-`C¹` immersion on `[[a, b]]`** — `IsPiecewiseC1On` strengthened, over a **common**
breakpoint witness, by a non-vanishing tangent on every piece: on each breakpoint-free closed piece
`[c, d]`, the curve is `C¹` and its within-piece derivative is non-zero on **all** of `[c, d]` —
one-sided at the piece endpoints, HW's `Λ̇|_{[aₖ,aₖ₊₁]} ≠ 0` (arXiv:1808.00997, p. 3). This is the
raw-`γ` mirror of the `derivWithin_ne_zero_pieces` field of AINTLIB's `ClosedPwC1Immersion` (whose
closed partition includes the interval endpoints; closedness itself stays the theorems' separate
`γ a = γ b` hypothesis), the type its HW summit is stated over; `SatisfiesConditionA'` is likewise
typed over an immersion, since the on-cycle model-sector analysis needs a well-defined non-zero
tangent at each on-cycle singularity. The one-sided conditions are load-bearing: merely asking
`deriv γ ≠ 0` off a finite set would admit zero-speed turnarounds (`γ t = t ^ 2` on `[-1, 1]`,
whose one-sided tangents both vanish at `0`) and zero-speed seams, which are not immersions.
`derivWithin` is used because at a corner the global `deriv` is `0` by Mathlib convention, which
would falsely contradict non-vanishing; at interior points of a piece it agrees with `deriv`.
Implies `IsPiecewiseC1On` with the same witness (pieces with `c ≥ d` are degenerate). (The homology
Cauchy theorem, whose singularities lie *off* `γ`, needs only `IsPiecewiseC1On`.) -/
def IsPwC1ImmersionOn (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ContinuousOn γ (Set.uIcc a b) ∧
    ∃ p : Finset ℝ, ↑p ⊆ Set.Ioo (min a b) (max a b) ∧
      ∀ c d : ℝ, c < d → Set.Icc c d ⊆ Set.uIcc a b → Disjoint (↑p : Set ℝ) (Set.Ioo c d) →
        ContDiffOn ℝ 1 γ (Set.Icc c d) ∧
          ∀ t ∈ Set.Icc c d, derivWithin γ (Set.Icc c d) t ≠ 0

/-- A cycle `γ` on `[a, b]` is **null-homologous** in `Ω` when its winding number about every point
outside `Ω` vanishes (`n_w(γ) = 0` for all `w ∉ Ω`) — the hypothesis of the homology Cauchy theorem
(Layer 3) and of HW Thm 3.3 (Layer 4). -/
def IsNullHomologous (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (Ω : Set ℂ) : Prop :=
  ∀ w ∉ Ω, windingNumber γ a b w = 0

/-- HW condition **(A′)**: the cycle `γ` approaches each on-cycle singularity in `S` transversally,
meeting it as a finite union of model sectors, **flat of order equal to the order of `f`'s pole
there** (HW §3). One of the two regularity conditions that make the principal value exist; stated
explicitly so the summit is honest. The prescribed pole orders come from `f` (read off by
`meromorphicOrderAt`), so `f` is part of the data: the point set `S` alone cannot supply them. -/
def ConditionAprime (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) (S : Finset ℂ) : Prop :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.ConditionAprime γ a b f S

/-- HW condition **(B)**: the higher-order Laurent principal parts cancel under the
sector-cancellation identity at each on-cycle singularity, so the principal value exists for poles of
order `> 1` (HW §3). Couples `f` with the parametrization of `γ` (entry/exit tangents). -/
def ConditionB (γ : ℝ → ℂ) (a b : ℝ) (f : ℂ → ℂ) : Prop :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.ConditionB γ a b f

/-! ## Layer 1: the geometry of the winding number (HW §2)

The model-sector values, computed directly from the integral, are the per-indentation contributions
the valence formula sums. (Stated on the raw integral, which `windingNumber` packages as a PV.) -/

/-- **The model-sector winding number** (HW (2.4)). A counterclockwise circular arc of opening angle
`α` about its centre `z₀` contributes generalized winding number `α/2π`:
`(2πi)⁻¹ ∫_0^α (γ'/γ) dθ = α/2π` for `γ θ = z₀ + r·e^{iθ}`. The geometric meaning of the winding
number at a corner — specialising to `½` at `i` and `1/6` at `ρ`. -/

      = (α : ℂ) / (2 * (Real.pi : ℂ)) :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.indexIntegral_arc hr α

/-- **The winding number `½` at `i`** — the coefficient of `ord_i(f)` in the valence formula. `i` is
a *smooth* boundary point of the fundamental domain, so the valence contour indents around it by a
**semicircle** (`α = π`), with generalized winding number `π/2π = ½`. -/
theorem windingNumber_at_i {z₀ : ℂ} {r : ℝ} (hr : r ≠ 0) :
    (2 * (Real.pi : ℂ) * Complex.I)⁻¹ *
        ∫ θ in (0:ℝ)..Real.pi, deriv (circleMap z₀ r) θ / (circleMap z₀ r θ - z₀)
      = 1 / 2 :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_at_i hr

/-- **The winding number `1/6` at `ρ`.** `ρ` is a **`π/3` corner** of the fundamental domain, so the
contour indents around it by a `π/3` arc, with generalized winding number `(π/3)/2π = 1/6`. The two
`ρ`-corners (`ρ` and `ρ+1`) each contribute `1/6`, summing to the `1/3` coefficient of `ord_ρ(f)`. -/
theorem windingNumber_at_rho {z₀ : ℂ} {r : ℝ} (hr : r ≠ 0) :
    (2 * (Real.pi : ℂ) * Complex.I)⁻¹ *

      = 1 / 6 :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_at_rho hr

/-- **`n_c(circle) = 1`** — the closed-curve normalization gate (reconciles with
`circleIntegral.integral_sub_center_inv`). A full counterclockwise circle about its centre `c`
(`α = 2π`) has generalized winding number `1`; `n` is `0` outside. -/
theorem windingNumber_circle {c : ℂ} {r : ℝ} (hr : r ≠ 0) :
    (2 * (Real.pi : ℂ) * Complex.I)⁻¹ *

      = 1 :=
  EpsilonEridani.Contour.windingNumber_circle hr

/-! ## Layer 2: the argument principle and the classical residue theorem -/

/-- **Local argument principle** — the per-orbit input to the valence formula. If `f` is meromorphic
on the closed disc `C(c, R)` and `c` is its only zero or pole there, of order `n = ord_c f`
(`meromorphicOrderAt`), then `∮_{C(c,R)} f'/f = 2πi · n`: the contour integral of the logarithmic
derivative recovers the order (the residue of `f'/f` at `c` is `ord_c f`). (Boundary regularity is
not hypothesised — it follows from `honly` with `R > 0`, since the centre is the only special point.)
Mathlib has `logDeriv` and `meromorphicOrderAt` but not this. -/

/-- **The argument principle** — the valence formula's contour identity. For `f` meromorphic on the
closed disc with all zeros and poles contained in a finite set `S` inside the open ball, with integer
orders `ord`, `∮_{C(c,R)} f'/f = 2πi · Σ_{z ∈ S} ord_z(f)`: the contour integral of `f'/f` counts
zeros minus poles with multiplicity. The explicit identity the valence formula evaluates two ways
(here over the interior orbits); the on-contour points `i`, `ρ` are handled by HW Thm 3.3 (Layer 4).
(Boundary regularity follows from `hsupp` and `hS`, so it is not hypothesised.) -/

/-- **Classical residue theorem (circle case)** — Layer 2, the case provable from Mathlib's disc
Cauchy theory: a circle bounding a disc with the poles strictly inside (integer winding number `1`
each). For `f` meromorphic on the closed disc with all singularities in a finite `S ⊆ ball c R`,
`∮_{C(c,R)} f = 2πi · Σ_{s ∈ S} Res_s f`, recovering the Cauchy integral formula. The general
arbitrary-cycle / null-homologous version is deferred to Layer 3+ (its `S = ∅` case is the homology
Cauchy theorem). -/

/-! ## Layer 3: the global (homological) Cauchy theorem -/

/-- **The homology (global) Cauchy theorem** (Layer 3, proved by *Dixon's argument*). For `f`
holomorphic on open `Ω` and a closed cycle `γ` in `Ω` that is **null-homologous**, `∮_γ f = 0`. This
is the `S = ∅` case of the general arbitrary-cycle residue theorem, which is why that general version
sits here rather than in Layer 2. Named for the theorem (homology Cauchy), attributed to Dixon for
the proof. -/

/-! ## Layer 4: the Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem (HW Thm 3.3) -/

/-- **Hungerbühler–Wasem generalized residue theorem** (HW Thm 3.3) — the summit. Let `U ⊆ ℂ` be
open, `S ⊆ U` finite, `f` holomorphic on `U ∖ S` and meromorphic at each `s ∈ S`, and `γ` a
**null-homologous** closed piecewise-`C¹` **immersion** in `U` whose singularities may lie *on* `γ`, under
conditions (A′) and (B). Then the principal value exists and
`PV (2πi)⁻¹ ∮_γ f = Σ_{s ∈ S} n_s(γ) · Res_s f`, with the generalized (non-integer) winding numbers
as weights. The basepoint stays off the poles (`hγa`) so every crossing is interior to the
parameter interval — for the intended nondegenerate closed immersions with finite `S` this is
mathematically removable by cyclic reparametrization, but it remains a formalization residual
until a reparametrization-invariance API exists (it is likewise a hypothesis of the AINTLIB
summit). Subsumes the classical residue theorem (poles off `γ`, integer weights) and the
half-residue case below.

Scope, relative to the printed theorem: HW state Thm 3.3 for a *cycle* and a singular set
without accumulation points in `U`, and allow an essential singularity on the cycle where the
cycle is locally straight (condition (A)'s second branch). This target takes a single closed
curve, a **finite** `S`, and `MeromorphicAt` at each `s ∈ S` — the scope the
`residue`/`meromorphicOrderAt` API expresses and the valence formula consumes. Each narrowing
is deliberate, not an oversight; cycles are a finite-sum layer over this statement. -/

/-- **Half-residue: the winding-`½` on-cycle case of HW Thm 3.3** — the acceptance gate and the
bridge to the valence formula's `i`, `ρ`. Stated as the genuine `S = {s}` specialisation of
`hungerbuhlerWasem_residueTheorem`: a **closed, null-homologous** piecewise-`C¹` **immersion** `γ` in an
open `U`, with `f` holomorphic on `U ∖ {s}` and meromorphic at `s`, under conditions (A′)/(B); when
the generalized winding number about `s` is `½`, the principal value equals `πi · Res_s f` — the
`S = {s}`, `n_s(γ) = ½` case of the HW sum `2πi · Σ n_s(γ)·Res_s f`. The closedness,
holomorphy-off-`s`, null-homology and (A′)/(B) hypotheses are **load-bearing**, not decoration:
without them the whole PV integral is *not* determined by `n_s(γ)` and `Res_s f` alone (a non-closed
arc integrates the holomorphic part of `f` to a nonzero remainder — e.g. `γ(t) = e^{i t}` on
`[0, π]`, `s = 0`, `f z = z⁻¹ + 1` has winding `½` and residue `1` but integral `πi − 2`). -/
